Meet Raptive Creatorbot: Engage site visitors with an AI-driven chatbot based on your content. Enjoy seamless Q&A, discover related posts, and boost user engagement.

== Description ==

Introducing Raptive Creatorbot, the revolutionary plugin transforms your website into a highly interactive experience. Designed to engage your visitors, Raptive Creatorbot is an AI-powered chatbot that simulates conversation with you, based on your site's content. This cutting-edge technology not only answers questions but also helps users find related content, keeping them engaged and helping increase your site's revenue.

Raptive Creatorbot stands out from the competition by training specifically on your site's content to reduce mistakes and accurately recreate your tone and voice.

Easy to install and configure, the plugin seamlessly integrates with your WordPress site as both a stand-alone chat page hosted on `/chat` and as a "Let's Chat" button that shows up in the bottom right corner of your pages.

**NOTE:**
_This plugin is exclusive to Raptive creators. It is currently being tested with a small number of sites and will not work until Raptive enables it._
